# Minesweeper Game

A classic Minesweeper game implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Description

Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle game where the objective is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden mines without detonating any of them. The game board is initially covered with tiles, some of which conceal mines. The player must strategically reveal tiles, using numeric clues to identify nearby mines. The game is won when all non-mine tiles are revealed, and lost if a mine is revealed.
